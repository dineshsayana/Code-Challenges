* ###Unique Element Sum

Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all unique elements. An element is considered unique if it appears exactly once in the list.

Input:

A list of integers nums (1 <= length of nums <= 10^4).
Each integer in the list is between -10^4 and 10^4.
Output:

An integer representing the sum of all unique elements in the list.
​

Examples:​
Input: [1, 2, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: Only 1 and 3 are unique, so their sum is 4.
​
Input: [1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no unique elements.
​
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 15
Explanation: All elements are unique, so their sum is 15.
